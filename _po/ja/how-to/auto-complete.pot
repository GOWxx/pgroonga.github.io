msgid "Auto complete is useful feature for easy to use search box. PGroonga has features to implement auto complete."

msgid "You can implement auto complete by combining the following searches:"

msgid "  * Only for Japanese: Prefix RK search for auto complete by readings"

msgid "  * Loose full text search"

msgid "## Sample schema and indexes"

msgid ""
"```sql\n"
"CREATE TABLE terms (\n"
"  term text,\n"
"  readings text[]\n"
");\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Auto complete candidate terms are stored into `term`. Readings of `term` are stored in `readings`. As you know, type of `readings` is `text[]`, multiple readings are stored into `readings`."

msgid "[Prefix RK search][groonga-prefix-rk-search] is a prefix search variant. It supports searching [katakana][wikipedia-katakana] by [romaji][wikipedia-romaji], [hiragana][wikipedia-hiragana] or katakana. It's useful for Japanese."

msgid "Note that you need insert only katakana in `readings`. This is required to search auto complete candidate terms with prefix RK search."

msgid "Then use [`&^~` operator][prefix-rk-search-v2] against `readings` for prefix RK search. Here are some examples about prefix RK search."
