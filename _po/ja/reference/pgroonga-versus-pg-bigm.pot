msgid "# PGroonga versus pg\\_bigm"
msgstr ""

msgid "PostgreSQL doesn't support full text search for non alphabet based languages such as Asian languages including Japanese, Chinese and Korean by default. There are some third party modules to support Asian languages. PGroonga is one of them. [pg\\_bigm](http://pgbigm.osdn.jp/index_en.html) is another module. There are some textsearch parsers such as [zhparser](https://github.com/amutu/zhparser) for Chinese and [textsearch\\_ja (not maintained)](http://textsearch-ja.projects.pgfoundry.org/textsearch_ja.html) for Japanese."
msgstr ""

msgid "The pg\\_bigm module is similar to the [pg\\_trgm]({{ site.postgresql_doc_base_url.en }}/pgtrgm.html) module. The pg\\_trgm module doesn't support Asian languages by default but the pg\\_bigm module supports them."

msgid "## Characteristics"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are characteristics of each modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "### PGroonga {#pgroonga}"
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga is fast for searching because it doesn't need \"recheck\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga is also fast for searching while updating because it doesn't block searching while updating. PGroonga doesn't decrease search performance while updating."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga is also fast for alphabet based languages and Asian languages mixed case. PGroonga uses N-gram based full text search by default. It's similar to pg\\_bigm because pg\\_bigm uses 2-gram (N is 2 case of N-gram). But PGroonga uses variable size N-gram. N-gram is slower for alphabet based languages because the number of letter types are few in alphabet. It's about 26 (\"a\" to \"z\" and more). Posting list in inverted index will be longer when the number of letter types are few. (If you're not familiar with inverted index, you may not understand this description.) See also [PGroonga versus textsearch and pg\\_trgm](pgroonga-versus-textsearch-and-pg-trgm.html). You can find pg\\_trgm that uses N-gram based full text search is slower. PGroonga uses word based full text search instead of N-gram based full text search for alphabet based languages even if the target text mixes alphabet based languages and Asian languages such as \"私はPostgreSQLユーザーです。\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga is also fast for updating."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga index is large because it keeps index target text that is already stored in PostgreSQL."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga index isn't crash safe. You need to run [`REINDEX`]({{ site.postgresql_doc_base_url.en }}/sql-reindex.html) when your PGroonga index is broken by crash."
msgstr ""

msgid "### The pg\\_bigm module {#pg-bigm}"
msgstr ""

msgid "The pg\\_bigm module is crash safe because it uses GIN. GIN is crash safe."
msgstr ""

msgid "The pg\\_bigm module is slow when many documents are matched and each document is long. Because pg\\_bigm need \"recheck\" after index search."
