msgid "## Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three parts to the integration. First is notification to spring that a custom registration of functions is required. The second step is to register all desired operations with separate function names for use in Hibernate. The last step is using the functions in your HQL or JPA queries."

msgid "## Register with Spring"

msgid ""
"Under resources, in the **META-INF/services** folder create a file called **org.hibernate.boot.model.FunctionContributor** By creating this file in this location, Spring k nows to execute the class as part of bootstrapping Hibernate.\n"
"The content of the file is the fully qualified class name of a function contributor. The function contributor is what registers the customer function for use by Hibernate."

msgid "Below is a simple use case is for selected operations of pgroonga, and did not to leverage lower level commands. As such, I only needed to create a simple registration of the operations to Hibernate as custom functions.

"The FunctionContributor is effectively a contract to register new functions which when encountered in HQL will be translated. \n"
"There is a prebuilt tool for Pattern based substitution. The PatternFunction provides simple string replacement for the named function. The params passed into the function are sequentially numbered and prefixed by a question mark '*?*'."
