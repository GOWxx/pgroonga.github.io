msgstr ""

msgid "PostgreSQL provides GiST and GIN as bundled indexes. You can use them for full text search against languages that use only alphabet and digit such as English. You can't use them for full text search against Japanese, Chinese and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga's main feature is fast full text search against all languages. But PGroonga also provides general purpose index features for equality condition and comparison conditions. PGroonga provides more features rather than GiST and GIN. So you can use PGroonga as alternative of GiST and GIN."
